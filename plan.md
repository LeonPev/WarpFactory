# Python Rewrite Plan

This document outlines the plan for rewriting the MATLAB code in this repository into Python.

## Sub-tasks:

1. **Core Function Conversion:** Rewrite the core MATLAB functions in Python. This includes identifying equivalent libraries and functionalities in Python.
    * Dependencies: Completion of Task 1 (Understanding and Documenting the MATLAB Code).
2. **Library Handling:**  Address any MATLAB-specific libraries used in the code. This may involve finding Python alternatives or implementing custom solutions.
    * Dependencies: Core Function Conversion.
3. **Script Translation:** Translate the MATLAB scripts into Python, ensuring proper integration with the converted functions and libraries.
    * Dependencies: Library Handling.
4. **Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test the converted Python code to ensure it produces the same results as the original MATLAB code. This includes unit tests and integration tests.
    * Dependencies: Script Translation.
5. **Documentation and Updates:** Update the documentation to reflect the changes made during the conversion process. This includes updating README files and any other relevant documentation.
    * Dependencies: Testing and Validation.

## Order of Conversion:

The conversion will follow the order of the sub-tasks listed above. Each sub-task will be completed and reviewed before moving on to the next one.

## Dependencies:

Dependencies between components are outlined within each sub-task description.
